The best performing model for the task was the two-stream convolutional LSTM shown below, which is a fully recurrent deep network maintaining the spatial structure of the frames throughout the recurrences.

## Training

Look at the different shell-scripts available in `run_scripts` and `test_scripts` folders. An execution line with all flags specified may look like this

```python main.py --data-path 'data/jpg_128_128_2fps/' --model 'convolutional_LSTM' --input-width 128 --input-height 128 --nb-labels 2 --nb-lstm-units 32 --kernel-size 5 --nb-epochs 100 --early-stopping 15 --optimizer 'adadelta' --lr 0.001 --round-to-batch 1 --train-subjects '[3,0,1,2]' --val-subjects '[4]' --test-subjects '[5]' --subjects-overview 'metadata/horse_subjects.csv' --image-identifier 'unique_name' --test-run 0 --seq-length 10 --seq-stride 10 --batch-size 16 --nb-input-dims 5 --val-fraction 0 --data-type 'rgb' --nb-lstm-layers 4 --aug-flip 1 --aug-crop 1 --aug-light 1 ```, where

all flags are not applicable to all models, check `models.py`, `--lr` is the learning rate of the optimizer, `--round-to-batch` decides whether to discard the potential last batch if it has fewer samples than `--batch-size`, `train/val/test-subjects` designate the ID of which horse subjects to t/v/t on,  `--image-identifier` is a string to signify the results files that are saved after testing, to not overwrite results from different runs, `--test-run` is a binary variable deciding whether to just run a short test (just a few training steps instead of an entire epoch). `aug-flip`, `aug-crop` and `aug-light` are three different data augmentation methods that can be used at will.

*Note:* The batch size needs to be divisible with the number of augmentation techniques you use plus + 1. So if you use all three, i.e. flip+crop+light, the batch size needs to be a multiple of 4.

`--val-fraction` set to 1 means that we will use a certain last specified fraction of the training set as validation set, instead of using an "entire horse" as validation set as specified in `--val-subjects` (applied otherwise).

`--nb-input-dims` is 5 for sequences but 4 for single frames.
In the sequence case the dimensions of an input tensor to the network are (batch size, seq length, r, g, b) vs. in the single-frame case (batch size, r, g, b). The corresponding dimensions for optical flow input will also be 5 or 4, using the magnitude of the two flow channels as a third channel.

`--data-type` should be either of the strings `'rgb'` or `'of'` (optical flow).  

`--seq-length` is the sequence length (number of frames to constitute a sequence that is processed at once, and `--seq-stride` is the stride of the sequence extraction. If you just want back-to-back sequences with no overlap these two should thus be the same. 

## Testing

To only perform inference with an already trained Keras model, run

```python test_with_saved_model.py```

with the same argument flags as you trained the model with

after adding the model path to the main function of `test_with_saved_model.py`.

## Dataset

The equine dataset has unfortunately as of yet not been possible to make public, but is further described in the article

`Karina Bech Gleerup, Björn Forkman, Casper Lindegaard and Pia Haubro Andersen
"An Equine Pain Face"
Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia, 2015, 42, 103–114`.


However, the code can and has been used on the human pain video dataset UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain expression archive database, which is publicly available and described [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5771462).

To train and test the a model on your own data, no matter the species or affective state of interest, the below data format should be adopted.

### Data format

A data folder such as the one in the execution line specified above, `data/jpg_128_128_2fps/`, (let's refer to this folder by X) should be organized as follows:

X contains one subfolder per subject in the dataset (and once you have run, also their belonging `.csv`-files), like so:
 
```
ls X
horse_1 horse 2 horse_3 horse_4 horse_5 horse_6
```
These per-subject folders in turn contain one folder per clip, as in for example:

```
ls horse_1
1_1a_1 1_1a_2 1_1a_3 1_1b   1_2a   1_2b   1_3a_1 1_3a_2 1_3b   1_4    1_5_1  1_5_2
```

The clip-folders in turn contain the extracted frames for each clip.

and after the first run:

```
ls X
horse_1 horse_1.csv horse 2 horse_2.csv horse_3 horse_3.csv horse_4 horse_4.csv horse_5 horse_5.csv horse_6 horse_6.csv 
```

One `.csv`-file contains paths and label information for every frame of every clip for that particular horse. We use these to read the data.
From the beginning, the global label information for every clip is gathered from the `metadata/videos_overview_missingremoved.csv` file.
A list of the ID:s of the subjects of the dataset should also be provided in the `metadata`-folder.
